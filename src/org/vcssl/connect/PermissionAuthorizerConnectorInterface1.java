/**
 * An interface (abbreviated as PACI 1) for implementing permission-based security plug-ins.
 *
 * PACI 1 plug-ins receive requests of permissions from other plug-ins (through script engines),
 * and determine whether allow or deny it (or ask to the user to determine it, if necessary).
 *
 * What form of UI is suitable for the above determination highly depends on
 * the application's UI, purpose, and so on.
 * Hence, the application-side can design UI for the above determination,
 * and can connect (and use) it to script engines, by implementing this interface.
 *
 * Also, on PACI 1, following two types of permission settings are assumed to exist:
 *
 * <dl class="lang-en" style="margin-left: 30px;">
 *     <dt>Base permission settings:</dt>
 *         <dd>
 *         Settings which is set to applications/script engines explicitly,
 *         and applied automatically to each script at the beginning time of its execution.
 *         </dd>
 *     <dt>Temporary permission settings:</dt>
 *         <dd>
 *         Temporary settings kept only during each script is running,
 *         of which values may change by user's responses for requests of permissions.
 *         </dd>
 *
 * When the script is executed, at the beginning, values of the base permission settings
 * are copied to the temporary permission settings.
 * During the script is running, values of temporary permission settings are referred
 * (and modified if necessary), when any permission is requested.
 * When the next script is executed, values of the temporary permission settings
 * are re-initialized by copying values of the base permission settings.
 *
 * The reason of why the temporary permission settings exists is: to avoid repeating the same request to an user.
 * For example, when the base permission for writing files is set to {@link ConnectorPermissionValue#ASK ASK},
 * if the temporary permission does not exist, we should ask the user to determine whether allows it or not,
 * for every time when write a line to a file (we should ask 100 times for writing 100 lines).
 * It must be troublesome, so it is necessary to provide an option such as:
 * "Allow the same request automatically, during the current script is running".
 * In order to implement the above feature, the temporary permission settings exists.
