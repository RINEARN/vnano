	 *
	 * Why we use "int" for this value, not "long", is to avoid to make the updating process of this counter "synchromized".
	 * If this counter is "long", the writing to it may consists of two operations (32bit x 2), depends on environment.
	 * So if the value is read from an other thread just when its value is being written, the broken value may be read,
	 * if we don't make the writting/reading action "synchronized".

	 *
	 * For the same reason, we don't make this value "volatile",
	 * so some time lag may occurs for this value, by the effect of the "thread cache" mechanism.
